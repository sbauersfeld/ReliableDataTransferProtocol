# ReliableDataTransferProtocol
An FTP client and server that implements a reliable data transfer protocol similar to TCP. Additionally, serverCC.cpp, clientCC.cpp, and globalsCC.h implement a congestion control algorithm. Because these programs run over UDP, and UDP implements a checksum, the checksum portion of the reliable data transfer protocols has been commented out. In order to include checksums, simply uncomment those lines in globals.h and globalsCC.h.
